    "#### **The return**\n",
    "\n",
    "The so-called return at time $t$ is the cumulated reward obtained from the entire duration of an episode. Recall that $R_{t+1} = r$ is the immediate reward obtained after performing an action, $A_t$, at time $t$; the `subsequent` rewards are $R_{t+2}$, $R_{t+3}$, and so forth.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo methods address one of the main limitations of **Dynamic Programming (DP)** — the need to know the environment’s full transition dynamics $`p(s', r | s, a)`$. Instead, MC methods learn **directly from experience** by interacting with the environment and estimating value functions based on **sampled returns**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of Monte Carlo methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No knowledge of environment dynamics**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The agent does not need transition probabilities or reward distributions.\n",

    "\n",
    "When approximating (Q(s, a)) with a neural network, updating the weights for one state-action pair can inadvertently change the Q-values of other states. Additionally, standard neural network training assumes **IID (independent and identically distributed) samples**, which is violated when learning from sequential transitions in RL.\n",

    "1. **Break temporal correlations:** By storing transitions and sampling randomly, we reduce the sequential correlation between states in episodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Revisit past experiences:** Earlier state-action pairs remain in memory and can be used multiple times for training.\n",
